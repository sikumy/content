If you're a _pentester_ or work in security audits, you know how important it is to have tools that optimize your workflow and allow you to keep a clear record of your activities. Today we're going to look at _[Oh My Pentest Report](https://github.com/sikumy/ohmy-pentest-report)_, a custom theme for Oh My Zsh that I created a few months ago to improve my day-to-day work.

## What is it about?

_[Oh My Pentest Report](https://github.com/sikumy/ohmy-pentest-report)_ is an _Oh My Zsh_ theme created with the goal of offering a _prompt_ that is not only visually clear, but also includes practical features for everyday use, such as automatic command logging and dynamic display of relevant information. Among its most notable features are:

- Date and time display: Shows the current date and time, ideal for documenting when certain tests were performed. It's also useful for knowing how many minutes a command took to execute.
- Dynamic IP address: Allows you to display the IP of a specific interface (like _tun0_ for _VPNs_), a manually configured IP, or even the public IP (useful for external audits). The interface IP is checked every 10 seconds in case it changes, and the public IP every minute.
- Command status: Indicates if the last command was successful (white ❯ symbol) or failed (red ❯ symbol), and displays a special symbol (# in yellow) if you're _root_, which again turns red if the last command failed.
- Command logging: Automatically saves all executed commands in a _~/.pentest\_history_ file with the format _DATE - IP - COMMAND_, so you can know all the commands you've executed along with their date, time, and IP. The latter in case you've configured it, otherwise, the default IP of the _eth0_ interface will be used.
- Two-line _prompt_: By default, the _prompt_ is two lines, due to the great length the _prompt_ can have if everything is enabled. Even so, you can easily modify the theme to use a single line.
- Git support: When you access a directory where there's a Git repository, the branch you're working on and an asterisk symbol if there are edited files without _commits_ are automatically added to the _prompt_.

Below, you can see a screenshot showing how the _prompt_ looks with all its features activated:

Additionally, you can edit the default value of some configurations by editing the theme file itself:

## Theme installation

If you don't have ZSH installed and/or set as the default _shell_, you can do the following:

```bash
sudo apt install zsh -y
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

If you already have ZSH but don't have _Oh My Zsh_, you can install it as follows:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Once you have both, it's time to install the _Oh My Pentest Report_ theme. The process is very simple and straightforward:

```bash
# Clone and install the theme
git clone https://github.com/sikumy/ohmy-pentest-report/ $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/ohmy-pentest-report
mv $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/ohmy-pentest-report/ohmy-pentest-report.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/ohmy-pentest-report.zsh-theme
# Configure .zshrc
sed -i 's/ZSH_THEME=".*"/ZSH_THEME="ohmy-pentest-report"/' ~/.zshrc
# Add the following command to .zshrc. You need to add it before the line "source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh"
zstyle ':omz:alpha:lib:git' async-prompt force
# Reload the terminal
exec $SHELL
```

And with that, everything would be ready. You would have the theme active in your terminal.

## Available commands

By default, IP and date/time display are disabled to keep the _prompt_ clean, but you can easily activate them with specific commands. Here's a summary of the most useful commands:

- **Enable/Disable Date and Time**

```bash
enabledate  # Shows the date and time in cyan
disabledate # Hides the date and time
```

- **Enable/Disable IP**

```bash
enableip   # Shows the configured IP
disableip  # Hides the IP
```

- **Configure IP**

```bash
setip 192.168.1.100 # Static IP
setip eth0 # Interface IP
setip public # Public IP (updates every minute, you can modify this time in the theme)
```

- **Enable/Disable everything**

```bash
enableall  # Enables IP and date/time
disableall # Disables IP and date/time
```

## Command logging (~/.pentest\_history)

As mentioned before, one of the most useful features of _Oh My Pentest Report_ is its automatic command logging system. Each executed command is saved in the _~/.pentest\_history_ file with the format _DATE - IP - COMMAND_. For example:

```plaintext
28/10/23 16:38 - 192.168.1.100 - nmap -sV target.com
```

As stated, having this log is very useful for knowing exactly what commands you executed, from which IP, and at what time.

## Customization

If you want to adjust the date format, _prompt_ symbols, or colors, you can directly edit the **ohmy-pentest-report.zsh-theme** file. For example:

- Date Format: You can modify the _get\_datetime_ function to change how the date and time are displayed.
- Symbols: You can change the symbols for successful command (_cmd\_symbol\_success_), failed (_cmd\_symbol\_fail_), or _root_ user (_cmd\_symbol\_root_) and failed _root_ user (_cmd\_symbol\_root\_fail_) by editing their respective functions.
- Colors: You can also adjust the color codes so the _prompt_ adapts to your preferences.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, _Oh My Pentest Report_ is a theme I made to improve my daily work. The clean _prompt_, its practical features, and its automatic command logging make it perfect for staying organized during audit activities.
