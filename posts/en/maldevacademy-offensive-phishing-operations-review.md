If we delve into the world of cybersecurity courses (or any other sector, really), it's most common to find a lot of basic and introductory courses that present themselves like this:

![Example of basic cybersecurity courses](https://cdn.deephacking.tech/i/posts/maldevacademy-offensive-phishing-operations-review/maldevacademy-offensive-phishing-operations-review-1.avif)

However, the further you advance in a field and the more you search for specialized and complex topics, the less information you'll find, or at least, the less centralized it will be. This is where MalDev Academy courses stand out. Some time ago, we published an article about their _[malware development course at MalDev Academy](https://blog.deephacking.tech/en/posts/maldevacademy-malware-development-review)_, highlighting its structure and content. Now, it's time to explore the second course on their platform: _[Offensive Phishing Operations](https://maldevacademy.com/phishing-course)_.

Offensive Phishing Operations is a course designed for those who want to learn about advanced phishing. It focuses on creating secure phishing infrastructures, evading modern detection mechanisms, and how to perfect offensive operations tactics.

## What does it offer?

The course is structured in modules that range from fundamentals to advanced techniques, allowing everyone to progress at their own pace. Among the key topics explored are:

- Secure infrastructure configuration: You'll learn to deploy a robust phishing infrastructure, from selecting domain names with operational security criteria (OpSec) to configuring web servers like Apache, Nginx, and Flask.
- Detection evasion: It delves into the methods that defenders and security providers use to detect phishing sites, such as _[Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)_, and teaches strategies to evade them, such as using HTML Smuggling and fingerprinting (JA4, JARM, etc.).
- Anti-bot measures: The course covers advanced techniques to prevent bots and automatic scanners from detecting your site, such as implementing custom CAPTCHAs, detecting spoofed user agents, and user behavior analysis.
- Obfuscation and anti-analysis: You'll learn to obfuscate frontend code with tools like _[Obfuscator.io](https://obfuscator.io/)_, use dynamic encryption (AES, XOR), and generate dynamic content to make analysis of your site more difficult.
- Domain reputation management: Strategies to improve a domain's reputation are explored, such as domain aging, categorization, and generating legitimate web traffic.
- Advanced techniques like Adversary-In-The-Middle (AITM): Using tools like Evilginx, the course teaches how to collect passwords and TOTP codes for multifactor authentication (MFA) bypass.

## Structure and Methodology

Like the malware development course, this course is also module-based, allowing students to advance at their own pace and review content when needed. Currently, it has over 80 modules and is regularly updated with new content. For example, in April 2025, modules on infrastructure automation with Ansible and advanced JA4 analysis for bot detection were added, while in May 2025, an update is expected with topics like Website Fingerprinting and SVG Smuggling.

Each module includes clear learning objectives, ready-to-use code snippets, and configuration files that students can implement directly on their servers. Additionally, the course also encourages research beyond the base content to delve even deeper into the concepts taught.

## Who is this course for?

Offensive Phishing Operations is primarily aimed at those who want to learn or face detection challenges when setting up phishing sites during security exercises. However, it's also a very valuable course for defenders who want to better understand attacker tactics and improve their phishing detection strategies.

The recommended requirements to start the course are: knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and a basic understanding of Linux server configuration. You don't need to be native developers in those languages, but at least knowing a minimum of programming in general is recommended. In addition to this, you do need to have a virtual private server (VPS) and a registered domain, as some modules use paid services like SSL certificates or APIs. You can always take the course without practicing, and take the theoretical knowledge for when you need it, but practice is irreplaceable and of course, highly recommended before moving to the real scenario.

## Additional benefits

In addition to the entire course, MalDev also offers you the following:

- Completion certificate: Upon completing the main modules, students receive a certificate that accredits course completion.

- Continuous updates: As mentioned before, the course stays up to date with the latest techniques and trends in phishing, ensuring that the content is always relevant. So you're not only buying the current course, but an even more complete course that will improve over time.

## So, is it worth it?

Any MalDev Academy course is worth it: they offer high-quality training, with purely technical content and at a very reasonable price compared to other companies in the sector. This course, like the malware development one, stands out for its practical and detailed approach. It doesn't just focus on theory, but also provides real tools and techniques that you can apply immediately. Additionally, its modular structure and the ability to access ready-to-use code make it an ideal option for both beginners and experienced professionals.
