Hey there! 👋

I’m Juan Antonio González Mena, creator of **Deep Hacking**.

My goal with this project is to build a centralized place where complex topics can be learned in a simple way, a project by and for the community. Here we’re not going to tell you:

- Promises that you’ll become the best hacker after paying for an outrageously expensive course with 98% employability.
- Magic formulas to go from newbie to pro in 6 months.
- Stories about getting rich with cybersecurity.
- Or any of those clichés you’re probably tired of seeing on social media.

This started as a personal blog where I shared what I learned on my journey through cybersecurity. Over time it has changed, with its ups and downs, but always with the same essence, a place made by and for the community.

The people who write here don’t aim to be “the experts” in the field, nor do they need to be. We’re technology and security enthusiasts who enjoy learning, trying things, and sharing when we can.
