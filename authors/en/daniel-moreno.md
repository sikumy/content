Hey there! I'm **Dani**, aka **eldeim**. Yes, I'm in love with cybersecurity, especially hacking/pentesting. Cybersecurity has been with me since childhood and now I only think about three things: hacking, hacking, and smash burgers with pickles. I work as a pentester and I'm determined to achieve my personal goals and dreams. I have no limits.
