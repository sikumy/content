Hey there 👋. I'm **Juan Antonio González Mena**, although many people know me as **Sikumy**. I'm 24 years old and have been working in the cybersecurity world for over four years. I'm also the creator of this blog you're reading.

Deep Hacking started as simple personal notes. Over time it grew, evolved, and through its ups and downs, has become what it is today: **a space created by and for the community**.

I don't know how far this project will go or what paths it will take, but what I do know is that my goal is for it to become a technical reference. Time will tell. In the meantime, I'd love for you to join me on this journey.
