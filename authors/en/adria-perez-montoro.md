Hey there! My name is Adrià, though you probably don't know me. Maybe my nickname rings a bell: b1n4ri0. Yes, it has numbers and letters, just how hackers like it. I'm 18 years old and self-taught. I spend most of my free time studying, and the rest thinking about projects and tinkering with all sorts of things. I'm naturally curious, fascinated by physics, mathematics, and neuroscience, and of course, offensive cybersecurity, which is what I dedicate most of my time to.

So far, I've created a Spanish low-level community (Яeverse ESP) and I share my content wherever I can, aiming to get as many people as possible hooked on this amazing world. I've collaborated and continue to collaborate with various communities, so you might know me from one of them.

Just to be clear, I'm starting to dive into the world of exploiting and reversing, although I also have solid knowledge of pentesting, plus a few certifications (eJPT, eCPPT, CRTP, CARTP, and OSWP, for now). Cheers!
