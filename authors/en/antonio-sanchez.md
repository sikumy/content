Hellooo! I'm **Toni**, and my hacker name (what a cool word by the way) is **sh0x**. I'm 25 years old, a Computer Engineer, and I also hold a Master's degree in Cybersecurity from the European University of Madrid, and I'm from Córdoba. I've been working professionally as a Pentester in the Cybersecurity field for 3 years, and my certifications include **OSCP**, **OSWP**, and **CRTP**.

Beyond my job, I'm also a professor in the Cybersecurity Master's program at UEM, I was a speaker at **RootedCON 2023**, I give talks every year to students at the University of Córdoba, where we founded **"Hackademics Forum"**, a free event for all attendees to get closer every year to learning about research and industry trends. And with that said, I'll stop talking now.

You can reach me on Telegram **@ToniSan88** if you have any questions or just want to chat about cyber.
