Hello! My name is **Julio Ángel Ferrari**, I'm from Seville and my alias in the hacking world is "T0X1Cx". I'm a Full-Stack developer but passionate about offensive security since I was 14 years old. Currently, I've been working as a Pentester for 4 years and I hold certifications such as eJPT and eCPPTv2 (although I have a few more pending this year). 🎯

In my free time, I'm passionate about finding and reporting vulnerabilities, so I also have two CVEs: CVE-2024-34361 and CVE-2024-34362.

I also enjoy sharing knowledge: I've given talks at some high schools in Seville and have been a professor for the Cybersecurity Diploma at Loyola and the Master's in AI and Data Analytics. 📚🤖

If you want to talk about hacking and any other topic, write to me on Telegram @T0X1Cx!
